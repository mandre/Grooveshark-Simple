# Grooveshark Simple

A minimal version of [Grooveshark Remote Control][grooveshark_remote_control]
with just the play/pause, previous, and next buttons.

All credit goes to Hernán Rodríguez Colmeiro for his wonderful add-on.

## Requirements

This extension is coded with the new [AddonSDK][addon_sdk_homepage] for
Firefox, so if you want to fork this and contribute some code, first you need
to get the AddonSDK. To do that, just follow the steps in the [AddonSDK
Repo][addon_sdk_repo] page.
