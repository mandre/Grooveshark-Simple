# Grooveshark Simple
A minimal version of [Grooveshark Remote Control](https://github.com/peregrinogris/Grooveshark-Remote-Control) with just the play/pause, previous, and next buttons.

## Requirements

This extension is coded with the new [AddonSDK](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/) for Firefox, so if you want to
fork this and contribute some code, first you need to get the AddonSDK. To do
that, just follow the steps in the [AddonSDK Repo](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/) page.
